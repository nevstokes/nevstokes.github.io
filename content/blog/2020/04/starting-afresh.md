At some point in recent history -- thanks to various hard drive failures and misplaced USB sticks -- I lost the backups of my old WordPress site. Let's face it, its demise was certainly no great loss for humanity.

After a long break, what better time than during lockdown to restart the cathartic outpourings?

Hopefully my writing will be a tad more focussed than my previous inane ramblings -- although there's little doubt that those will still make the occasional appearance. I plan on writing more about my work; software development, security and engineering -- touching on various languages, frameworks, containers, cloud architectures, tools and practices.

There will also be some cycling-related posts, documenting my rides and reviewing equipment, along with my general plans and approaches.

A lot of this stuff will be already written elsewhere; why am I bothering?

For one thing, it will be easier to find the content if I need to refer to it in the future. It also means that I can add my own slant on a topic.

Primarily though, I'll find it useful as a check on my comprehension of something; if I can't write about it with confidence then I've maybe not quite fully understood enough to be clear in my mind.

Similarly, if I am missing anything, having my thinking documented will then -- hopefully -- allow others to set me on the right path.
