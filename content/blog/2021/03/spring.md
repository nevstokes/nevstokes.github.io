Before the snows of last week, springtime was very much on the cards with snowdrops and winter acconite making an appearance on the paths around the north of Edinburgh. Now crocuses are emerging, along with early blossom on the tree in front of my flat and the promise of daffodils and bluebells flowering before too much longer.

Another sign of Spring for me was the Strada Bianche taking place at the weekend, the race being among the early season cycling Classics and Monuments leading into the better-known Grand Tours of Le Tour, Giro and Vuelta.

These took on new meaning for me last year. Never mind being delayed due to the pandemic, that they even went ahead at all was an extemely welcome glimpse of semi-normality -- offering much-needed spells of escapism. The scenery from the routes was as stunning as ever and having the commentators and their conversation over the hours on the road as company while staying at home really broke the monotony. Personally, I think that there's really only Test-match cricket that can compare as something to have in the background, to dip in and out of during the course of a day without requiring your full attention.
