These days I find myself working on smaller, distributed pieces of code rather than a monolithic structure. Consequently, I don't really need a heavyweight language-specific IDE anymore. I'm almost exclusively using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and it is working _extremely_ well for me. It's familiar enough to feel likea natural progression of [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), sprinkled with some features from Adobe's [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets). Looking at the stats, I'm fairly sure that I'm safe to say that I'm [not alone](https://hackernoon.com/the-rise-of-microsoft-visual-studio-code-a3d143490a52) in adopting it.

As Roben Kleene eloquently explains, it looks like [VS Code is here to stay](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2020/09/21/the-era-of-visual-studio-code/); having a major technology company behind an actively developed Open Source product that has a healthy third-party ecosystem delivering extra functionality is a very nice situation in which to be.
