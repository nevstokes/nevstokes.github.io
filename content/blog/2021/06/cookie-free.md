As of today, any existing instance of the single cookie that was previously set by my website will have expired.

To be clear, this cookie wasn't set by me. Rather it was originally set by Cloudflare and was [deprecated](https://blog.cloudflare.com/deprecating-cfduid-cookie/) by them 30 days ago.

My original goal of a personal site that is entirely free of client-side scripts, cookies, pixels, fingerprinting or any other tracking technology has been realised.

Since relaunching my blog, Cloudflare have also [enabled HTTP/3](https://blog.cloudflare.com/last-call-for-quic/) for me -- which was nice of them. Now it's just down to the browser vendors to catch-up with the technology.
