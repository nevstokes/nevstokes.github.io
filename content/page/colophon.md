Social icons were selected from the Simple [Brand library](https://simpleicons.org/) and the theme icons chosen from [Feather](https://feathericons.com/), used under the CC0 1.0 Universal License and MIT respectively. SVGs for both were generated by [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/app).

Fonts used are [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand) for general content in conjunction with [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro) for monospaced text, both used under the Open Font License. Code snippets are displayed in the [Monokai](https://monokai.pro) theme and the inline notes functionality was inspired by [Cupper](https://thepaciellogroup.github.io/cupper).

## Conventions
Multiline code snippets -- as might be expected to be found in a file -- will have numbered lines. Single lines of CLI code will be prefixed with a <code>$</code> to signify a simple `bash` prompt; these will sometimes be reformatted with line continuation characters for improved readability.
