subtitle: Who am I?

Not only a fantastic [Jackie Chan movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127357/), but a perfectly valid question, given the circumstances. You're reading this so I'm assuming you have at least a passing curiosity as to my background.

There's likely much more to be gleaned from following the social links way down there in the footer but, by way of brevity (not my strong point), here's the pr√©cis:

Although I was born and raised in Halifax, West Yorkshire, I've lived in Edinburgh, Scotland for pretty much all of my adult life. I moved here to study Computer Science at university and basically stuck around after graduation.

When not working, researching, experimenting, studying or generally tinkering, I enjoy reading, cooking, road cycling, mountain biking and - given a chance - skiing.
