My front-end skills have definitely got a bit rusty from underuse in recent years; I guess I missed it more than a little. And, wow, how complicated is it these days? I know it doesn&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to be, but I freely admit that I kind of enjoy playing with the tools &ndash; of which there are a ridiculous amount.</p><p>I used to work at a design agency for a long time so I picked up one or two things along the way. Now I&rsquo;m not claiming that I can actually <em>design</em> anything myself, nor that I necessarily fully understand all of the subtle nuances that contribute to an effective implementation, but I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s really important in order to be able to appreciate the difference that at least some attention to detail can make.</p><p>Things like a fully responsive layout, performance, accessibility, custom fonts and establishing a vertical rhythm for your typography.</p><h2 id=choices>Choices</h2><p>Adopting a mobile-first strategy, I chose to expose my main navigation on smaller devices rather than collapsing the links into a JavaScript-powered burger menu and to instead reflow the layout for larger screens.</p><p>The big thing in terms of performance though is that there&rsquo;s no JavaScript as standard at all; absolutely no tracking or analytics libraries.</p><p>This is a personal blog; I&rsquo;m not a business trying to ensure my marketing budget is being well spent and I have no goals to convert. I&rsquo;m also not really concerned with vanity metrics like page views.</p><p>Were I so inclined, I <em>could</em> get some rough numbers from Cloudflare but primarily this is an outlet for me to write about things in which I&rsquo;m interested and sometimes to transcribe the thoughts that are swirling around inside my head &ndash; those that need externalising occasionally in order to let me sleep.</p><h2 id=technologies>Technologies</h2><p>Webpack, Flexbox, subsetted WOFF2 fonts, Brotli and AVIF compression for content and images, HTTP/2 and resource preloading all contribute towards delivering tiny, performant sites built to work in a progressive manner with modern evergreen browsers.</p><p>Couple all of these advancements with static generation to massively reduce the attack surface for any miscreants looking to take control of a site and you&rsquo;re in a really good place.</p></article><nav><a href=https://nevstokes.com/blog/2020-04-16-starting-afresh/ title="Starting Afresh">&#171; Previous Post</a>
