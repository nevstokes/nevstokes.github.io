Adhereing to the <a href=https://www.outdooraccess-scotland.scot/practical-guide-all/camping>Scottish Outdoor Access Code</a> and principles of responsible access, I&rsquo;d planned my ride to arrive late and intended to leave early the next morning.</p><h2 id=the-outward-journey>The Outward Journey</h2><p>Accordingly, I cycled out of the city for a couple of hours shortly after dinner. Passing through Gifford, I continued along the road over the Redstone Rig before turning off and heading along the Herring Road.</p><p>The road is so named due to being the path that 18-19th century fishwives used to cross the moors from Dunbar to market in Lauder, often with a 50kg load of salted herring on their backs; I can only imagine the hardships and conditions they must have endured.</p><p>As the sun began to set, I pulled off the path and found a spot to set up my bivy for the night and prepare my overnight oats while having a good slice of fritata by way of supper.</p><p>The previous time I stopped for the night in this vicinity was on the way to watch the Tour of Britain sprint pass through Duns at the start of September last year. That time I was treated to a perfectly still and cloudless sky and, as the moon sank behind the hills, a spectacular view of the Milky Way by which to fall asleep.</p><p>Last night &ndash; theoretically at least &ndash; I should have been able to see the comet Neowise. However, that wasn&rsquo;t to be. Instead, just as I was drifting off, there were a couple of tremendously bright flashes which I initially mistook for lightning. Slightly concerned that the weather forecast had been massively wrong, I opened my eyes to witness the brightest meteor I had ever seen streak through the heavens as it skimmed across the firmament.</p><h2 id=return-to-civilisation>Return to Civilisation</h2><p>Waking early, I had breakfast while packing up before pushing on to Whiteadder reservoir. These days, the northern part of the Herring Road is quite tricky to follow &ndash; especially on a bike. I opted to cheat a little and follow the maintenance roads of the still-growing Crystal Rig wind farm.</p><p>My timing did mean that I met the early shift of works traffic heading up the hill as I descended towards Spott. Thankfully, the approaching vehicles were kicking up plenty of dust so I had advanced notice to reign things in.</p><p>Picking up the John Muir Way at Dunbar, I made my way to North Berick and &ndash; evntually &ndash; found somewhere for a socially-distanced second breakfast. I then continued back toward Edinburgh, through the Archerfield Estate and Gullane, hugging the coast as much as I could through to Musselburgh and Portobello Promenade before arriving in Leith.</p><p>All in, across the two days, the route was about 140km of some beautiful and varied terrain along mostly-quiet roads and historical paths. Definitely something I&rsquo;ll be going back to again at some point.</p></article><nav><a href=https://nevstokes.com/blog/2020-06-28-out-with-the-old/ title="Out With the Old">&#171; Previous Post</a>
