      <description>At some point, thanks to various harddrive failures and misplaced USB sticks, I lost the backups of my old Wordpress site. Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, its demise is certainly no great loss for humanity. After a long break, what better time than lockdown to restart the cathartic outpourings?
Hopefully my writing will be a tad more focussed that my previous inane ramblings - although there&amp;rsquo;s little doubt that those will remain. I plan on writing more about my work; development and engineering, touching on various languages, containers, cloud architectures, tools and practices.</description>
