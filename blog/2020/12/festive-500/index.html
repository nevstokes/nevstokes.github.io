This year, being this year, things were always going to be somewhat different.</p><p>Along with a couple of hundred thousand others around the world, assuming either single or those with long-suffering - but understanding - partners, I&rsquo;d decided to attempt the <a href=https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/stories/F500-a-challenge-by-half>Rapha Festive 500</a> for the first time. For the uninitiated, this event simply challenges you to ride 500km between Christmas Eve and New Year&rsquo;s Eve.</p><p>Given I&rsquo;ve barely clocked up 800km all year, hitting 500km in about a week was going to be a bit of a struggle in itself; I&rsquo;d need some kind of strategy to compensate for my lack of general fitness, the limited hours of daylight available and the toe-numbing temperatures forecast.</p><p>I decided on a few things</p><ul><li>Ride a few (comparatively) bigger days with some smaller ones mixed in around my commitments.</li><li>Keep away from the hills as far as possible.</li><li>Make use of the <a href=https://www.innertubemap.com/>shared path network</a> around the north of Edinburgh as they&rsquo;re much smoother than the roads and not all that far from my front door which meant I could return home to refuel and rest up as and when required.</li><li>Wear my merino <a href=https://road.cc/content/review/97845-defeet-woolie-boolie-2-merino-socks>Woolie Boolie</a> socks and then wrap my toes in tinfoil before putting on my shoes and overshoes.</li></ul><p>Accordingly, I mapped out a rough 16km loop with options to extend or vary in places and set out to make as big a dent in the kilometres as I could on Christmas Eve. As most of the circuit was on shared paths I wasn&rsquo;t going fast; I&rsquo;d given myself the chance to stretch the legs a bit with a sprint along Princes Street and the drop down to Canonmills. During my brief forays into town I did notice just how quiet things were on the roads but there were still quite big (socially distanced) queues at the various fishmongers and butchers that I passed. It had been cold overnight so I was glad to see that Edinburgh Council had apparently invested in new equipment that actually distrubuted the grit salt across the path rather than dumping it in a thin line.</p><p>On Christmas Day, my decision to stay close to home paid off as I punctured before even reaching 5km. While I changed my inner tube I was more than a little taken aback my the number of people who stopped to offer some help. Not just fellow cyclists but joggers and those out for a walk while the turkey was cooking asked if I was okay or if I had everything I needed; the Christmas spirit was clearly running high. Repairs made, I rode home to pick up another spare and pump up the pressure properly with my track pump while having a coffee.</p><p>After a rest on Boxing Day, I had a couple of smaller solo rides before heading out east with a friend where we investigated the Haddington Railway Walk and had a play on the Musselburgh BMX track on the way home.</p><p>With two days to go and 177km left, I woke up to a blanket of snow outside. I swapped over to Sealskinz socks for the day and pushed back my start to let things warm up a bit before taking a look at the state of the paths and discovering that the Council had reverted to type; the snow and ice on the untreated surfaces made any progress pretty trecherous. The roads, of course, had been cleared so I changed surfaces and headed out of town as initially planned, finding that the snow had completed disappeared within a very short distance.</p><p>On the final day I had 86km to cover and largely repeated the ride of the previous day (without venturing on to the paths) - keeping to the flat, popular and well-travelled route out to North Berwick and back. I came home to more falling snow which seemed appropriate for the season but also made me glad that I&rsquo;d achieved my goal with a day to spare.</p><p>As a consequence of these past several days, two things moved up my wishlist: an indoor trainer and a pair of winter cycling boots.</p><p><svg aria-label="Posted in"><use xlink:href="/symbol-defs.svg#icon-tag"/></svg>#<a href=https://nevstokes.com/tags/cycling/>cycling</a>&nbsp;</p></article><nav><a href=https://nevstokes.com/blog/2020/09/taxing-affairs/ title="Taxing Affairs">&#171; Previous Post</a>
