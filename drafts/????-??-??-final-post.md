platitudinous quote "don't cry because it's over..." - if you weren't to cry would mean that I had little impact on your life. That said, it would be an act of tremendous hipocracy. All grief is different.

My brother was serving in Iraq at the time and there had been a terrible spate of incidents in the news. So when I answered the phone that morning and heard my mum's voice breaking, it was only logical that I assumed the worst. That the news was that it was my dad that'd died was the thing that literally knocked me off my feet.

Once I'd recovered, sitting on the kitchen floor, I still remember almost asking my mum if she wanted me to come home; thankfully, I stopped myself at the last second. I told my flatmate Sam and called Dennis who I'd been planning on going to the gym with that morning.

One of the first actions I took was to delete his number from my phone while I was on the train back to Halifax. It took me a week to cry after my own father's death; it didn't click that my uncles had lost their brother.

I was in my early teens before I had the crashing realisaion that other people were not merely actors in my life.

From the outside it might seem strange to say that I never truly embraced life.

I kept myself in a state of perpetual emotional numbness as a protection mechanism; I'd never allow myself to really get close to anyone. I became adept at compartmentalisation, deflection and avoidance. I can't say that I endured any traumatic loss. Character flaw.
