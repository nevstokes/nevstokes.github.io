I've always considered tardiness orthogonal to politeness. In my opinion, turning up late for a meeting implies that you don't respect the other attendees; if you're running late, at least endeavour to let your colleagues know.

Working remotely; could that meeting have been an email afer all? Don't substitute a Zoom call for a meeting.

Made everyone think a little more. A meeting isn't just an informal chat; it requires structure and planning.

If you're calling a meeting, it's your responsibility to ensure that you're making the best use of everyone's time. You may have heard of various quantities of Ps, including -- but not limited to -- Purpose, Products, Process, People, Preparation.

Personaly, I tend to consider six Os.

<dl>
    <dt>Organisation</dt>
    <dd>Who, where, when, how.</dd>
    <dt>Outline</dt>
    <dd>Set the agenda. Why you're calling this meeting. Include any suggested pre-reads.</dd>
    <dt>Objectives</dt>
    <dd>What you're expecting to get out of the meeting - purpose.</dd>
    <dt>Ordnance</dt>
    <dd>Set the ground rules. For example, ask people to leave their phones alone or their laptops behind.</dd>
    <dt>Outputs</dt>
    <dd>What the meeting will generate</dd>
    <dt>Outcomes</dt>
    <dd>The implications of the outputs</dd>
</dl>

Ultimately, however you think about it, every meeting should have a reason and everyone should feel like they are in a position where they could contribute. These expectations should be communicated with your invite.
