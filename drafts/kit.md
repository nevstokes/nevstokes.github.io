I have a Garmin 820, a (2020) iPhone SE and a pair of off-brand waterproof in-ear headphones with in-line mic and controls. Yes, they're wired - one less thing to charge. I don't listen to music or podcasts while on a ride, I'm quite happy being in my own headspace and focussing on the road and my surroundings, purely for navigational alerts.
