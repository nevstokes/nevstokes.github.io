Enforce invariants: what should always or never be true?
e.g. unused regions, 0.0.0.0/0

IDE plugins: DevSkim & Vuln VSCode


; developers know how they work best. That congitive dissonance of being forced to use what amounts to an alien environment is jarring, will slow them down and potentially breed resentment. Yes, devs care. Plugins, extensions -- whatever they're called exist for most combinations.

Or you can just run a container. Get consistent versioning and upgrade path.

Do as much as you can locally to get that feedback before pushing for the CI to give things a deeper inspection.

Scaled security
Mindset:
automate and streamline
guardrails not gatekeepers
high signal low noise tooling
get adopting by making the new way better than before
enforce wrappers so that the secure way is now the default
minimise friction, fit with existing tools & workflows
self-service
not individual bug squashing but removing entire classes of bugs
secure defaults
paved roads (Netflix) for secrets, auth, encryption
taxonomy -- not checklist
automated SOC runbooks
automated least privilege (Policy Sentry & RepoKid) -->
