While playing around and developing the theme for this blog, I got the structural order of paging links wrong; the link on the left of the page was for the next blog post, that is to say, the one dated immediately after the one that I was viewing.

Not for the first time I got to wonder about website navigation and cultural conventions used to represent the linear flow of time in a two-dimensional medium. In which direction does time actually move? Is it really actually from left to right? Is our language anything to do with this? Is time something that actually moves at all?

It's one of the (many) things that I'm in no way qualified to talk about, but would quite like to know more. Faces on coins future.
